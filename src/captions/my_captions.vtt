I am the owner and founder of Makina Cafe  

00:07.001 --> 00:07.726
Hi, my name is Eden Gebregziabher.

00:12.700 --> 00:15.106
Today, I am going to be showing you guys how to make Dorowet

00:16.098 --> 00:20.755
It is the national dish of Ethiopia and also eaten in Eritirea.

00:20.755 --> 00:25.200
So, this process is something that you absolutely can not expedite


00:25.300 --> 00:29.100
You have to be patient, you have to make sure you clean up the chicken really really well.

00:29.300 --> 00:36.000
The way that you serve it is actually serve the entire chicken, it is 12 pieces that go into the Dorowet

00:36.200 --> 00:44.100
The skin by itself is one part, but we are here in the US and I don't like the skin that much, 
So, I like to remove it.

00:44.200 --> 00:52.000
If you don't have time to do an entire chicken, the best part at least for me is the dark part.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.500
This process back home when they cook this dish, just cleaning of the chicken is almost like a half a day process

00:59.897 --> 01:05.800
You have somebody that's going to go and get an actual live chicken. They kill it, unfortunately. Sorry

01:06.200 --> 01:12.619
You skin it, and you actually completely part the chicken into 12 pieces.

01:13.200 --> 01:25.740
So, you just kind of pierce it a little bit, 
so that when you cook it, you wanna make sure the juice and all the sauce goes in there which gives it even better flavor.

01:25.845 --> 01:29.200
We just soak it in, hold water right here, you just pour it

01:29.400 --> 01:39.000
And I will cut about two or so lemons, squeeze it in, leave it in there. I will leave it for about 30 minutes to an hour or so.

01:39.010 --> 01:43.500
You want to make sure you go back and wash it again and rinse it and re-rinse it

01:43.671 --> 01:48.400
In the mean time, the most important part which is the onion, we are going to get started with that

01:48.450 --> 01:53.500
So, we are going to need a lot of onions for this. We use red onions. Why? All my ancestors used red onions.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.800
Also, white onion has extra water, so you are going to be cooking this and stewing it and simmering it for a long time, for many hours.

02:01.900 --> 02:10.473
So, you want to make sure that you get an onion that one, has a lot of flavor, and then number two, it also doesn't release a lot of water.

02:11.200 --> 02:19.200
I prefer to chop it up into finer chops, but it's up to you if you want to chop it into bigger pieces

02:19.500 --> 02:25.800
Or if you want to do it in a faster way and use a processor, you can also do that just make sure you don't completely puree the onion

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
And it's ok if you cry as well. I am surprised I'm not crying. Maybe I'll start in a little bit.

02:31.500 --> 02:38.300
This dish is enjoyed best when you cook it at home. You can enjoy it in a restaurant, but usually, because it takes a very long time, 

02:38.707 --> 02:42.500
the best Dorowet you will ever have is at somebody's house.

02:42.700 --> 02:48.500
So, what I am going to do is I'm going to go ahead and add the onions, no oil, no nothing.
I'm going to put it on medium heat

02:50.200 --> 02:55.679
You're just going to let the onions sweat the water out. This process by itself takes about an hour or so.

02:55.700 --> 03:03.630
You want to make sure the red onion is completely cooked not only is it completely cooked, it changes its color

03:04.000 --> 03:13.591
From what it is right now into a brown, and we're just going to continue to stir, so your arm is going to be your best of friends today.

03:13.600 --> 03:22.654
In the mean time I'm going to chop off some garlic and some ginger, and throw it in there, just add a little bit of oil.

03:27.339 --> 03:30.400
We have this paste in almost every household.

03:30.600 --> 03:37.010
So, as you can see the onion starts slowly color, looking so beautiful, we're just going to continue to mix it.

03:37.110 --> 03:43.600
We're going to add some boiled eggs at the end. So, we're going to boil some eggs, about six or so of them.

03:43.700 --> 03:52.425
We're going to bring the water to boil, add a little bit of salt, drop the eggs in there, cook for about 15 or so minutes.

03:52.800 --> 04:00.450
Your main job is paying attention to this.You don't want the onion to stick to the bottom and burn it and so, you're constantly stirring.

04:00.500 --> 04:05.070
So you're mixing it, coming back after 5 minutes, mixing it again, coming back.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.500
If you skip this process, you're not going to get the same results.

04:08.650 --> 04:15.500
That sweetness, that earthly taste that it has after you take your first bite, you're not going to get that as well.

04:15.650 --> 04:21.800
The eggs are almost done, so I'm just going to take it out. We're just going to peel the eggs.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.400
One of the reasons why I like the egg is, it's a nice break from the spice. And what you want to do is you want to cut it a little bit.

04:31.500 --> 04:38.200
We do this so that the sauces can go inside.This is the last thing that we are going to add before the dish is complete.

04:38.400 --> 04:45.500
Now the most exciting part, the onion has been cooking for an hour and some change, it is nice and beautiful and brown.

04:45.750 --> 04:54.000
So, I am going to add a little bit of oil and then I am going to add my paste (ginger and garlic).

04:54.700 --> 05:05.835
I have lowered down the temperature around this time. I want to make sure the flavors don't cook too fast. So I have it on medium low.

05:06.200 --> 05:14.450
Berbere is really the backbone of every Ethiopian and Eritrean cooking. This is a spicy dish by itself.

05:14.600 --> 05:24.300
So you can kind of gauge in how spicy you want it. But I like to put about 4 or so depending on the type of berbere it is.

05:25.300 --> 05:33.900
If you've had Ethiopian food or Eritrean food or never had it, this is pretty much what we use in almost a lot of our cooking.

05:34.100 --> 05:41.000
Anything that you see red, it is made with berbere. This is very important, you don't want to put this on high heat.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.400
You want to make sure that your berbere doesn't burn and so you're going to just keep stirring.

05:45.500 --> 05:54.300
And if it looks like it is a little bit on the drier side, I like to keep hot water close to me, so I'll just pour a little bit, a tad bit.

05:55.800 --> 06:02.300
And you're just going to continue to stir, that's all you're going to do. This particular spice blend is my absolute, absolute favorite.

06:02.500 --> 06:11.200
It is, almost every household they make it, their own version of it. It is about seven or eight spices that's mixed in together.

06:11.700 --> 06:19.200
Chili pepper is the main one, you add cardamon, you add cumin, dried ginger, dried red onion

06:19.210 --> 06:26.400
Pretty much any dried that you can think of. I love this not only just to make the stews but I feel like it's one of those underrated spices.

06:27.300 --> 06:33.950
The next spice that you're going to add is cardamon, so we're just going to do a sprinkle of this.

06:34.500 --> 06:43.200
Another thing that we're going to add is "Tazmir Kibbeh", clarified butter. Other people they call it "Gii" but "Gii" is a little bit different. 

06:43.400 --> 06:48.500
This has a lot of flavor. You do not need to add too much of it, you just need to use a small amount of it.

06:48.550 --> 06:56.900
But you can find this at any Eritrean, Ethiopian store. So I'm just going to add enough for the flavor, which I'll put about 1 or so.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.000
You also don't want to add too much oil. just simply because you are going to add butter.

07:02.500 --> 07:10.510
So, in regards to water, this is really up to your preference. If you like your Doro thick, then you add less water.

07:10.700 --> 07:17.700
If you like it more on the stewy side, then you add more water. It is time for the chicken to go in there and continue to cook.

07:17.800 --> 07:23.900
So, they've been sitting and soaking in the water for the last hour and some change. I'm just going to rinse it up and drop it in here.

07:24.500 --> 07:38.100
You want to keep washing it until the water is completely clear. We've washed it several times, we're just going to mix it in together.

07:38.150 --> 07:42.500
And, we're  just going to let the onion and the chicken cook really well.

07:42.550 --> 07:49.600
We're going to keep checking on it every few minutes just to make sure that it's cooking well and you're mixing it well

07:49.700 --> 07:59.750
and the chicken is cooked thoroughly. I'm going to cover it. We're going to cook the chicken for about 40 minutes or so.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.700
The last couple of steps we have is, we're going to add "mekelesha". This is optional but I highly recommend it.

08:06.050 --> 08:17.700
It has very similar spices as the clarified butter and even the berbere except the ones that's in here are more like nutmeg, cinnamon

08:18.000 --> 08:23.100
So, they are more like the warmer spices. So you just need to put a tad bit. 

08:23.500 --> 08:31.370
So make sure you don't put a lot, because that can overpower the dish. The chicken has been cooking for about 40 minutes or so.

08:31.500 --> 08:40.150
It looks really good and I am just going to sprinkle this, very little, not too much and then I'm just going to drop in the eggs.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
There we go, I don't want to mix in too much, sprinkle in some salt just to taste, this is up to your preference.

08:48.010 --> 08:54.500
I am going to cover this again, cook it for another 10 minutes and we will be ready to serve the dish. I am so excited.

08:55.300 --> 09:06.830
Alright look at that, that looks so good. This takes me automatically to my mom's my dad's house when they used to cook this dish.

09:07.000 --> 09:16.800
Our food is very communal and so we usually eat with like family and a big tray in the middle and the dorowet goes in the middle.

09:17.100 --> 09:23.000
And then you have all different side dishes, we have what we call Injera, It is our sour dough flat bread. 

09:23.600 --> 09:30.000
And I see a fork and a knife over here, but we don't do that over here. We eat with our hands, so make sure your hands are clean.

09:30.200 --> 09:41.100
Take a little bit of the sauce , I like to take a nice bite, a little bit of the egg, a little bit of the chicken, it's so nice and ready

09:41.500 --> 09:45.700
I am going to take a nice bite mmm.

09:47.400 --> 09:56.900
The onion that's been cooking for hours with our berbere, it almost melts in your mouth. It has a caramelized sweet after taste to it. 

09:57.000 --> 10:03.400
It's spicy and the boiled egg does a very good job cutting that spice.

10:03.460 --> 10:11.500
