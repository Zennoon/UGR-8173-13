I have chosen to construct wireframe and site map diagrams for a simple website about the Ethiopian Cuisine called ... well ethiopiancuisine.com
In the wireframe diagrams, as a general rule, I have represented div elements by black rectangles while other elements such as paragraphs and lists inside (children) and outside these div tags are in grey rectangles.
